## Intro
This keyboard was inspired by several others, including the Idobo70 & Lily58 and was designed to be constructed without a PCB (referred to within the community as a 'hand wire') 

Unlike other handwire keyboards this one is designed with beginers in mind and incorporates a bracket system to house the componants in a tidy and easy to understand manner.
It is a split-ortholinear keyboard which simplifies the wiring as well as allows a more comfortable typing experiance.

## Requirements
As there is no PCB you will only need access to a 3D printer as well as commonly available off the shelf parts.

#### Note
Right now the primary 3D printable components are still in active development and will be uploaded to the repository once they have reached a level of quality assurance that allows them to create a completed product

## Printable
Available right now to print is a Singular 3-Pin & 5-Pin Bracket, this proof-of-concept componant will make up the main structure of the electronics of the keyboard and contains the finer small details which you can print right away to test the tolerances of your 3D printer before you commit to printing all the other structural componants.

## Bracket Design
- 1x Kailh Hotswap Socket
- 1x Through-hole diode (Part no. 1N4148)
- 2x 22AWG sleeved wire *or* 2x 1.5mm brass tubes
- 1x 3-pin or 5-pin MX style keyswitch

---

## Final Design
The final product will require 70x the above as well as:
- 2x pro-micro micro controllers (or equivilant)
- 2x 24pin pro-micro sockets
- 4x 12pin male headers
- 2x I2C OLED Displays
- 2x TRRS sockets
- 1x Male to Male TRRS cable
